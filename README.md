# HTML Container

This project is a simple, practical template for static websites. Just upload it to GitHub Pages (or any static hosting), and your site is instantly live—no build process or backend required.

## Purpose

- Make it easy to share multiple HTML pages as a single site
- No frameworks, no build tools—just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Instantly view new pages by uploading them to the `/pages` folder

## How to Use

1. Upload this repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (or use any static web host).
2. Add new HTML files to the `/pages` folder. Each file becomes a new page on your site.
3. The navigation menu and directory update automatically—no code changes needed.
4. Access each page at `/pagename` (e.g., `/about`).

## Why Use This?

- See your changes immediately after upload—no build or deploy step
- Great for documentation, portfolios, or sharing multiple HTML demos
- Simple, clean, and easy to extend
